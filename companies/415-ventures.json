What we have over the other guys is that we do not take commissions out of the revenue the artists/bands make selling through us. We charge a one-time fee for setting up the album, and $20 a month for selling through us. In addition, we take the a lot of the stress out of out trying to get their music heard for indies because we provide a radio function that they can automatically add their music to, which is available for free streaming by ALL visitors. We also provide this service to major labels worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       38],      "assets/images/resized/0005/3041/53041v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       63],      "assets/images/resized/0005/3041/53041v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[450,       114],      "assets/images/resized/0005/3041/53041v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Founder/President",    "person":     {"first_name": "Babatunde",      "last_name": "Adepoju",      "permalink": "babatunde-adepoju"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "Facebook",      "permalink": "facebook"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "MySpace",      "permalink": "myspace"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "YouTube",      "permalink": "youtube"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "imeem",      "permalink": "imeem"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "Bebo",      "permalink": "bebo"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "",    "address1": "7415 Wilhelm Drive",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "20706",    "city": "Lanham",    "state_code": "MD",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": 38.9787174,    "longitude": -76.8835456}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  []}
