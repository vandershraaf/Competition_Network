Accnedo\u0026#8217;s first office server was based on a 486-DX4 100Mhz with 32MB Ram and a 500MB Hard disk. Some critics may say that this old PC was way past its retirement date, but this provided a challenge to see just how much can one get out of this system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccendo managed to install the PC with Debian Linux which took up approximately 200MB of disk space. The Server was then configured as a personal web server, dial-up server, mail server, file server, firewall, Database, and other smaller applications. It definately wasn\u0026#8217;t the fastest system around, but it served Accendo\u0026#8217;s purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis simple example led the way to providing such services to clients, by introducing Open Source Software, and showing them the benefits and increase in productivity, not to mention the lower operating costs that they would incur\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       51],      "assets/images/resized/0010/1510/101510v1-max-150x150.png"],     [[239,       82],      "assets/images/resized/0010/1510/101510v1-max-250x250.png"],     [[239,       82],      "assets/images/resized/0010/1510/101510v1-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": true,    "title": "VP of Business Development",    "person":     {"first_name": "Finbar",      "last_name": "Gallagher",      "permalink": "finbar-gallagher"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$1.56M", "funding_rounds":  [{"round_code": "angel",    "source_url": "http://www.rte.ie/business/2005/0125/accendo.html",    "source_description": "Accendo gets \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2 million from investors",    "raised_amount": 1560000.0,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2005,    "funded_month": 1,    "funded_day": 25,    "investments":     [{"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "Shannon Development Company",         "permalink": "shannon-development-company"},       "person": null}]}], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        104],       "assets/images/resized/0010/1511/101511v1-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[250,        173],       "assets/images/resized/0010/1511/101511v1-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[450,        312],       "assets/images/resized/0010/1511/101511v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  []}
