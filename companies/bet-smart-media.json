After being sourced, the data is normalized, optimized, and indexed. On top of this massive core dataset, a highly-advanced service layer (nicknamed \u0026#8220;the grid\u0026#8221;) has been authored. The grid is comprised of a series of APIs, proprietary query languages, and development frameworks, collectively representing a world of possibilities with the underlying sports data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBet Smart Media is now readying its core technology stack to become the ultimate platform to rapidly widgetize, automate, analyze, and/or develop any information technologies tangential to sports. We work with sports media networks, i-gaming sports betting companies, independent online sports publishers and developers of tablet, mobile, and web sports applications. Our market is basically anyone who needs sports data, requires automated processes related to sports data, or who would like premium stats-driven sports content for their projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the fall of 2011, Bet Smart Media is launching SportsWidgets.com as the destination to access this incredible sports technology platform. Bet Smart Media will be building out an ecosystem of clients, developers, and support services that will position SportsWidgets.com as the first and only stop you need to make for sports-related content, data, or development needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBe the first to know when SportsWidgets.com launches by joining our mailing list: SportsWidgets.com \u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       62],      "assets/images/resized/0006/1552/61552v9-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       104],      "assets/images/resized/0006/1552/61552v9-max-250x250.png"],     [[450,       188],      "assets/images/resized/0006/1552/61552v9-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [{"name": "WiseStats",    "permalink": "wisestats"},   {"name": "SportsWidgets.com",    "permalink": "sportswidgets-com"}], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Investor",    "person":     {"first_name": "Steven",      "last_name": "Dengler",      "permalink": "steven-dengler"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "Head Office",    "address1": "2nd Floor, 19 Bastion Square",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "V8W 1J1",    "city": "Victoria, BC",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "CAN",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [{"description": "Public launch of WiseStats.com",    "stoned_year": 2010,    "stoned_month": 8,    "stoned_day": null,    "source_url": "",    "source_text": null,    "source_description": "",    "stoneable_type": "Company",    "stoned_value": null,    "stoned_value_type": null,    "stoned_acquirer": null,    "stoneable":     {"name": "Bet Smart Media",      "permalink": "bet-smart-media"}},   {"description": "Steven Dengler announces investment in Bet Smart Media",    "stoned_year": 2011,    "stoned_month": 2,    "stoned_day": 24,    "source_url": "http://blog.betsmartmedia.com/news-release-bet-smart-media-welcomes-xe-com-ceo-steven-dengler",    "source_text": null,    "source_description": "Bet Smart Media Welcomes XE.com CEO Steven Dengler",    "stoneable_type": "Company",    "stoned_value": null,    "stoned_value_type": null,    "stoned_acquirer": null,    "stoneable":     {"name": "Bet Smart Media",      "permalink": "bet-smart-media"}}], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        142],       "assets/images/resized/0009/5158/95158v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        237],       "assets/images/resized/0009/5158/95158v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        426],       "assets/images/resized/0009/5158/95158v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null},   {"available_sizes":     [[[150,        112],       "assets/images/resized/0009/5159/95159v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        187],       "assets/images/resized/0009/5159/95159v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        337],       "assets/images/resized/0009/5159/95159v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://www.wisestats.com",    "title": "WiseStats"},   {"external_url": "http://blog.wisestats.com",    "title": "WiseStats Blog"}]}
