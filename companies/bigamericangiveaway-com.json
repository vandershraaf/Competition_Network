The public can enter giveaway competitions by liking the brand on Facebook, posting on their Facebook wall, following them on Twitter and engaging with the brand across the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBig American Giveaway works in the same way as a daily deals site, but instead of offering their products for significantly reduced prices, they offer their product in order to increase their social media profile. Every day, in 2012, the public, in every state, a giveaway day will be featured and, as a result, brands will significantly increase their social media profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiveaway days start at a $1 per day and increase by only $1 per day. So, 1st January, in each state is $1, 2nd of January $2, 31st December $366 (leap year). Brands can purchase their giveaway days on the website immediately. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce all days are sold the ultimate giveaway will be launched, to give one citizen of the USA, $1million in order to see their dream come true. The dream could be to launch a non-profit organisation, to release an album, to start a new business or to build a dream home. The public of the USA will decide who will win the $1million.\u003C/p\u003E", "image": null, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Director",    "person":     {"first_name": "Mark",      "last_name": "Bowness",      "permalink": "mark-bowness"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "London",    "address1": "53 Frith Street",    "address2": "Soho",    "zip_code": "W1D 4SN",    "city": "London",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "GBR",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  []}
