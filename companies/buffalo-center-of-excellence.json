This scientific mission is balanced by our responsibility to act as a facilitator of economic development in Upstate New York via partnerships with government, academia and industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Buffalo COE includes one of fifteen NYSTAR Centers for Advanced Technology. The University at Buffalo (UB) CAT focuses on biomedical and bioengineering translational research for development of useful products with commercial potential. By accelerating science transfer, the UB CAT will help foster the creation of new biotech start-up companies and help existing biomedical businesses expand through new or improved product lines.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       67],      "assets/images/resized/0009/6229/96229v2-max-150x150.jpg"],     [[250,       113],      "assets/images/resized/0009/6229/96229v2-max-250x250.jpg"],     [[450,       203],      "assets/images/resized/0009/6229/96229v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "",    "address1": "701 Ellicott Street",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "14203",    "city": "Buffalo",    "state_code": "NY",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  []}
