Founded in 1999, Cyworld was bought in 2003 by SK Telecom, Korea\u0026#8217;s primary provider of mobile telecommunications.  Since then Cyworld has experienced rapid growth, becoming a social networking phenomenon in South Korea.  In fact, Cyworld has claimed more than one third of Korea\u0026#8217;s entire population as members, while achieving incredible penetration of Korea\u0026#8217;s young adult market: 90% of Koreans in their 20s are members of Cyworld.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECyworld - US version - lets users sign up and create their own profile (called a Minihome in Cyworld) and their own avatar (Minime) for free.  You can then personalize your avatar, design a Miniroom, meet new people, stay in touch with friends, send messages, upload photos, exchange gifts, and more.  Essentially, Cyworld allows users to create their own personalized cyber-lives through which they can live vicariously, express themselves, and connect with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has recently expanded its social networking site to other countries including China, Taiwan, Japan, and now the US.  It is sure to face steep competition from US social networking giants \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace\" title=\"MySpace\"\u003EMySpace\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\"\u003EFacebook\u003C/a\u003E, and will face difficulty luring away US users who have been long-entrenched in their familiar social networks.  It will be interesting to see whether Cyworld\u0026#8217;s great success in Asia can translate to success in the US.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       41],      "assets/images/resized/0002/2359/22359v3-max-150x150.jpg"],     [[250,       68],      "assets/images/resized/0002/2359/22359v3-max-250x250.jpg"],     [[294,       81],      "assets/images/resized/0002/2359/22359v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [{"name": "Cyworld",    "permalink": "cyworld"}], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Board, CEO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Henry",      "last_name": "Chon",      "permalink": "henry-chon"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "Linden Lab",      "permalink": "secondlife"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "MySpace",      "permalink": "myspace"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "Club Penguin",      "permalink": "clubpenguin"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "Xiaonei",      "permalink": "xiaonei"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition":  {"price_amount": 7140000.0,   "price_currency_code": "USD",   "term_code": null,   "source_url": "http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952405.htm",   "source_description": "E-Society: My World Is Cyworld",   "acquired_year": 2003,   "acquired_month": 8,   "acquired_day": 5,   "acquiring_company":    {"name": "SK Telecom",     "permalink": "sktelecom"}}, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": null,    "address1": null,    "address2": null,    "zip_code": null,    "city": "Seoul",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "KOR",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [{"description": "muvee and Cyworld Announce Collaboration and New Service",    "stoned_year": 2008,    "stoned_month": 7,    "stoned_day": 18,    "source_url": "http://www.socialmediaportal.com/PressReleases/2008/07/muvee-and-Cyworld-Announce-Collaboration-and-New-Service.aspx",    "source_text": " Singapore, Korea, and San Francisco (PRWEB) -- muvee Technologies Pte Ltd, the pioneer and leader in automatic video editing, and Cyworld, South Korea's largest social networking site, today announced a new video editing service for Cyworld members. This new offering, which puts the power of muvee's patented technology in the hands of Cyworld's more than 20 million users, allows consumers to add music and unique styles to their videos and photos and create emotionally engaging muvees to share with their online friends and family. Cyworld users will ultimately have access to hundreds of online editing styles, which they can use with Cyworld credits called dotoris to automatically create muvees and then easily display on their mini Hompy (Home Pages).\r\n\r\n\"Years before the term 'Web 2.0' was coined in the West, Korea had already been at the forefront of what we now call social media and virtual worlds,\" said Terence Swee, CEO of muvee. \"muvee is proud to be Cyworld's chosen platform provider for a service that can both satisfy the ease of use and interactivity demands of discerning Korean internet consumers, and match the scale of Cyworld's service level requirements. This partnership is a strategic addition to our internet business, which complements global partners we have in the PC and mobile space.\"\r\n\r\nmuvee's goal is to help people to relive and share their special moments -- the planned, the unexpected, and everything in between. While Cyworld members can already share their personal media in its original form, they now have the opportunity to create something fun and new that will add an exciting twist and change the way they can express themselves.\r\n\r\nA recent study by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OEDC) found that South Korea has the world's highest household broadband penetration. South Korea is also known to have the most advanced mobile cellular network in the world. This has helped the South Korean population to become the most advanced consumers of social networking services both online and on mobile wireless networks.\r\n\r\nThe muvee making service is available today at www.cyworld.com.\r\n\r\nAbout muvee\r\nmuvee's software and services feature patented technology that lets people create and share professional-quality instant home movies out of unedited video, digital pictures and music. muvee develops consumer products for a range of platforms and devices including PCs, digital cameras, mobile phones and photo kiosks. muvee's global customers include HP, Dell, Nokia, LG, Sony, Olympus, Nikon and Creative Technology.
