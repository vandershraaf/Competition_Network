Ecoballot has analyzed the wasted paper of different schools and found that a significant source of paper waste is election ballots. Voting on paper wastes time, effort, energy, and paper; and yet many schools continue to vote with paper ballots because they have no other choice.  Ecoballot provides an affordable paperless solution to schools who want to vote electronically.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       28],      "assets/images/resized/0014/5567/145567v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       47],      "assets/images/resized/0014/5567/145567v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[400,       76],      "assets/images/resized/0014/5567/145567v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Chief Technology Officer",    "person":     {"first_name": "Warren",      "last_name": "Apel",      "permalink": "warren-apel"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "Headquarters",    "address1": "",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "60647",    "city": "Chicago",    "state_code": "IL",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null},   {"description": "",    "address1": "",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "",    "city": "Amsterdam",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "NLD",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        97],       "assets/images/resized/0014/5566/145566v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        162],       "assets/images/resized/0014/5566/145566v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        292],       "assets/images/resized/0014/5566/145566v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://www.manta.com/c/mvt2hc8/ecoballot",    "title": "Manta Listing"}]}
