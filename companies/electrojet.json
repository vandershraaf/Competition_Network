The ElectroJet product offers emissions reductions, regulatory compliance and greater fuel efficiency than carburetion. Small engines, such as those used in lawn mowers, are some of the largest polluters in the United States. Motorcycles and scooters are the mainstay of transportation in China and India where they currently manufacture in excess of 30 million motorcycles per year, contributing to the significant air quality issues in the region. With the help of ElectroJet, these products will consume less energy, perform better and pollute less.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       109],      "assets/images/resized/0011/3867/113867v1-max-150x150.jpg"],     [[217,       158],      "assets/images/resized/0011/3867/113867v1-max-250x250.jpg"],     [[217,       158],      "assets/images/resized/0011/3867/113867v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": true,    "title": "Board of Directors",    "person":     {"first_name": "Michael",      "last_name": "Psarouthakis",      "permalink": "michael-psarouthakis"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "HQ",    "address1": "7717 Lochlin Drive ",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "48116 ",    "city": "Brighton",    "state_code": "MI",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        106],       "assets/images/resized/0011/3868/113868v1-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[250,        178],       "assets/images/resized/0011/3868/113868v1-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[450,        320],       "assets/images/resized/0011/3868/113868v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  []}
