In March 2009, they launched a Beta version and demoed it at FinovateStartup 2009. Expensify\u0026#8217;s mission? Help people create expense reports that don\u0026#8217;t suck! In May 2009, Expensify raised $1M, hired some additional engineers, and went to Istanbul for a month in order to write the award-winning Salesforce.com Expensify application. Later that year, they demoed an integration of Outright and Expensify at TechCrunch50 2009. In December of 2009, Expensify 1.0 launched to high acclaim. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Expensify? Expensify imports expenses and receipts straight from your credit card or bank account, submits PDF expense reports by email, and reimburses reports up to $10,000 entirely online. With the 1.0 launch, Expensify bolstered its QuickBooks export features, helping bookkeepers, accountants, and finance departments nationwide to integrate their expense reports with ease. In September 2010, Expensify raised an additional $5.7M to keep fighting the war against sucky expense reports. A couple additional first-class engineers joined the Expensify team to clean up some rough edges, and went to the Philippines to focus on redesigning the previous Expensify UI. Increasing the number of mobile apps offered from 1 (the iPhone) to 4, including BlackBerry, Android, and Palm Pre, the Expensify team also added support for 159 international currencies, including automatic conversion to default currency. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter returning from the Philippines, Expensify has settled into a space in San Francisco\u0026#8217;s Financial District, hustling to exterminate some high-level bugs discovered after the redesign, cementing the foundation laid abroad in preparation for huge updates to the mobile apps and receipt features, and focusing on the future, when Expensify hopes to add even more new engineers to help them flesh out this incredible product. \u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       20],
