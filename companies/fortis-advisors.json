It requires a dedication of time and effort that most individuals cannot make.  If problems arise, the duties and responsibilities of the shareholder representative increase exponentially, and may even subject the representative to the risk of liability.  Shareholders are increasingly recognizing that it is a task they should not undertake and are looking for an alternative.  Fortis is the solution.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFortis allows shareholders to outsource the burden, responsibility and risk of shareholder representation to professionals with the dedication, experience and expertise to serve that role.  We manage all aspects of the post-closing process, including escrows, holdbacks, working capital and other purchase price adjustments and earn-out/milestone payments.
