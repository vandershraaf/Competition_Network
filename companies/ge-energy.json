GE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in the MFC-II stems from the Consortium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on modeling fuel combustion as a way to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Developing energy efficient and low emission combustors has become a key requirement for industrial turbines,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stated Lou Cerone, GE Energy Vice President, Energy Technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Modeling and simulation are critical elements in the cost-effective design of next-generation combustors that need to be cleaner burning, while capable of using a wide variety of fuels.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe MFC-II is the second phase of an industry led effort, which Reaction Design founded in 2005, to create validated simulation models that describe in detail the combustion of both conventional and alternative, carbon-based fuels. To date, the MFC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary focus has been to analyze fuels typically used in internal combustion engine applications, but the groundbreaking work done in characterizing the fundamentals of fuel-component combustion is equally applicable to the simulation of turbine engines used in both power generation and aircraft propulsion. As an MFC Member, GE gains access to more than 40 verified chemical-kinetics mechanisms and a set of proprietary software that supports the use of these mechanisms in the representation of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\u009d fuels in practical design simulations.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The addition of GE Energy, a leader in the energy industry, will help broaden the applicability of our Consortium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Bernie Rosenthal, CEO of Reaction Design. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Minimizing emissions of Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrous Oxides (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs) and soot is a requirement for producers of all types of combustion engines. The Consortium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work will hasten the development of cleaner, more efficient engines that can work with both traditional and emerging fuels.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nIn addition to GE Energy, current members of the Consortium include ConocoPhillips, l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Institut Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais du P\u00c3\u00a9trol (IFP), Mazda, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00c3\u00abn, Saudi Aramco, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen.
