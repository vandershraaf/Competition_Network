Instead of trying to find what you are looking for, what you are looking for finds you, exactly when you tell it to. A very interesting twist on customer engagement. The numbers suggest a significant \u0026#8216;re-commerce\u0026#8217; effect by using this tool. To at least test it out is a no-brainer. From the numbers we have seen additional revenue of 10% or more is possible with the same traffic you are already getting.
