After spending much time with little success, our path to achieve success changed. Initially focused on computer repair and small business IT support, we found that the anxiety caused by dealing with people was overwhelming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA new dream was born. Considering our limitation dealing with people, we refocused our services into the design of static html websites. After continued failure at attaining paying clients a decision was made. That decision was \u0026#8220;if they won\u0026#8217;t pay me to do it I will do it for free\u0026#8221;. The hopes was that by offering volunteer services we would turn paying clients as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch failure at volunteering, it took a long time to build a strong volunteer portfolio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow in our fifther year, we have still lost money and we are still volunteering. On occassion we recieve a paying client.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe defined ourselves as \u0026#8220;Integrity Technology Specialists\u0026#8221; when we opened our doors in 2006.
