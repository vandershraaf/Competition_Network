Or what some call, a socially conscious social network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJack donates more than half of all ad revenue generated by an individual\u0026#8217;s time online to their choice of more than 20 charities from across Canada and the US, and now the UK to the tune of 1.1 cents every impression (paid at par depending where the charity is registered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6or at least that is the theory\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the advertisers to date have been friends and family so I have been covering the 1.1 cents myself). The number of impressions and how you create them is up to you.  Simply sharing, viewing or commenting on pictures or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep thoughts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d makes cents!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJack also takes a \u0026#8220;softsell\u0026#8221;

JackTheDonkey.com is working to connect with individuals who are traditionally unengaged from anything remotely related to volunteerism and fundraising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is another key component to the site that we are rolling out in the near future which will provide an additional stream of funds for the charities on jackthedonkey.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more than  20 charities from across Canada, the US and now the UK that you can choose to support with your time online including: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAlex\u0026#8217;s
