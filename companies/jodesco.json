They have developed for iPhone and are currently in development for Android.  They are a three-person team that is passionate about tech and product driven.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKickback Card is loyalty cards for smartphones.\nIt has it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own deals (coming soon)\nIt scans any QR code.\nIt scans barcodes from your customer appreciation cards (e.g. grocery stores, pharmacies) and use them at the register.\nNo more junk cluttering up wallets and purses, digital loyalty cards, new deals, and your old barcode cards all in one place.\nDetailed vendor listings integrate with Yelp, Google maps/directions.\nThe app enables users to share kicks and kickbacks (earnings and rewards) with friends on Facebook.\nIn-app ads are actually relevant, deals from local vendors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Process:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomers scan QR codes from the vendor by using a \u0026#8220;kicker\u0026#8221; once they have purchased an item to earn their kick (earning).  Another way to earn a kick is through our \u0026#8220;paper kicks\u0026#8221;.  These paper kicks are handed out to customers if they do not have the app installed, the vendor is busy, or other reasons that as a quick handout is necessary so that the user can scan the QR code at their convenience.  The QR codes on the paper kicks are unique and can only be scanned once.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a user has enough kicks, they can redeem their kickback (rewards) with the participating vendor.  This process is simple and secure and requires no additional hardware to validate.\u003C/p\u003E", "image": null, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "co-founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "W.",      "last_name": "Scott Cain",      "permalink": "w-scott-cain"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "co-founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "Johnny",      "last_name": "Grenz",      "permalink": "johnny-grenz"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "co-founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "Derek",      "last_name": "Bredensteiner",      "permalink": "derek-bredensteiner"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "Punchd",      "permalink": "punchd"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "Cardagin Networks",      "permalink": "cardagin-networks"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "CardStar",      "permalink": "cardstar"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "Home Base",    "address1": "6729 E.
