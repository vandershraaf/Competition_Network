Members are able to view and create addictions and medical drugs and add them to their accounts and profiles.  They are also able to create and join support groups.  Then, users can network amongst themselves and help each other by supporting them and figuring out what\u0026#8217;s effective and what isn\u0026#8217;t.  Users may be as public or as private as they like and don\u0026#8217;t have to become a member to access the majority of the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause it is an original idea which, when compared to the very few other sites that are slightly similar in nature, nothing compares with regard to the amount of functionality, friendliness, usablity, amount of content (and potential content), and the amount of active development behind it.  This more \u0026#8220;2.0\u0026#8221; version of the website is much better compared to its late-2005 predecessor and with SEO in mind during development, among other avenues, projected traffic will be gradually increasing.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       38],      "assets/images/resized/0003/0195/30195v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       64],      "assets/images/resized/0003/0195/30195v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[450,       116],      "assets/images/resized/0003/0195/30195v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [{"name": "BeatingAddiction.com",    "permalink": "beatingaddiction-com"}], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "President",    "person":     {"first_name": "Alexander",      "last_name": "Kintis",      "permalink": "alexander-kintis"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "sobersocial.com",      "permalink": "sobersocial-com"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "soberrecovery.com",      "permalink": "soberrecovery-com"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "SoberCircle",      "permalink": "sobercircle"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "Orlando office",    "address1": "8815 Conroy Windermere Road",    "address2": "#407",    "zip_code": "32835",    "city": "Orlando",    "state_code": "FL",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": 28.4937313,    "longitude": -81.5072768}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        38],       "assets/images/resized/0003/0193/30193v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        64],       "assets/images/resized/0003/0193/30193v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        116],       "assets/images/resized/0003/0193/30193v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null},   {"available_sizes":     [[[150,        26],       "assets/images/resized/0003/0194/30194v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        43],       "assets/images/resized/0003/0194/30194v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[365,        64],       "assets/images/resized/0003/0194/30194v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://www.kinalcorp.com",    "title": "Kinal Corp corporate website"},   {"external_url": "http://www.beatingaddiction.com",    "title": "Beating Addiction website"}]}
