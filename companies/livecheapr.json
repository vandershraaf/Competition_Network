The idea was to help people out in finding good quality deals that they can enjoy without breaking the bank. With the help of a few connections and very little money, they finally established the site in February. Their signature phrase than and now remains the same: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any money, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t either.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of their connection they have featured merchants that no other Daily Deal company can get.  They feature deals that other competitors have had, but at a larger discount.  LiveCheapr was started by two people who knew how to get discounts and most importantly understood what good customer service meant.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       118],      "assets/images/resized/0013/6611/136611v2-max-150x150.jpg"],     [[250,       197],      "assets/images/resized/0013/6611/136611v2-max-250x250.jpg"],     [[450,       355],      "assets/images/resized/0013/6611/136611v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "President",    "person":     {"first_name": "Salman",      "last_name": "Jahedi",      "permalink": "salman-jahedi"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Vice President",    "person":     {"first_name": "Eugene",      "last_name": "Spivak",      "permalink": "eugene-spivak"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "Groupon",      "permalink": "groupon"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "Youswoop",      "permalink": "youswoop"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "LivingSocial",      "permalink": "livingsocial"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "BuyWithMe",      "permalink": "buywithme"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "DealOn",      "permalink": "dealon"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "kgbdeals",      "permalink": "kgbdeals"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[112,        150],       "assets/images/resized/0013/6609/136609v2-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[187,        250],       "assets/images/resized/0013/6609/136609v2-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[337,        450],       "assets/images/resized/0013/6609/136609v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null},   {"available_sizes":     [[[132,        150],       "assets/images/resized/0013/6610/136610v2-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[221,        250],       "assets/images/resized/0013/6610/136610v2-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[398,        450],       "assets/images/resized/0013/6610/136610v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://www.redeyechicago.com/news/ct-red-groupon-deal-overload-20110508,0,2107585.story?page=2",    "title": "The Big Daily Dealers"},   {"external_url": "http://www.depauliaonline.com/arts-life/depaul-alums-launch-biz-to-help-students-save-1.2189691",    "title": "LiveCheapr started by 2 students"},   {"external_url": "http://www.dailydealmedia.com/forum/topic.php?id=220",    "title": "The Real Deal to Frugality with LiveCheapr"},   {"external_url": "http://www.dailydealmedia.com/forum/topic.php?id=219",    "title": "Live Cheaper with LiveCheapr"}]}
