Originally inspired by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster\" title=\"Friendster\"\u003EFriendster\u003C/a\u003E, MySpace quickly grew to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest social network, before being overtaken by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\"\u003EFacebook\u003C/a\u003E. User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide\" title=\"Slide\"\u003ESlide\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube\" title=\"YouTube\"\u003EYouTube\u003C/a\u003E. MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia\" title=\"Intermix Media\"\u003EIntermix Media\u003C/a\u003E) in August 2003. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan\" title=\"Brad Greenspan\"\u003EBrad Greenspan\u003C/a\u003E, then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe\" title=\"Chris DeWolfe\"\u003EChris DeWolfe\u003C/a\u003E (later CEO), \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman\" title=\"Josh Berman\"\u003EJosh Berman\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson\" title=\"Tom Anderson\"\u003ETom Anderson\u003C/a\u003E (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation\" title=\"News Corporation\"\u003ENews Corporation\u003C/a\u003E bought eUniverse (renaming it \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia\" title=\"Intermix Media\"\u003EIntermix Media\u003C/a\u003E) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation\" title=\"News Corporation\"\u003ENews Corporation\u003C/a\u003E contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo\" title=\"Yahoo!\"\u003EYahoo!\u003C/a\u003E in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter being acquired, MySpace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues grew rapidly, as \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation\" title=\"News Corporation\"\u003ENews Corporation\u003C/a\u003E pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google\" title=\"Google\"\u003EGoogle\u003C/a\u003E made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn late 2006, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group\" title=\"Universal Music Group\"\u003EUniversal Music Group\u003C/a\u003E sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music\" title=\"MySpace Music\"\u003EMySpace Music\u003C/a\u003E, a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike\" title=\"iLike\"\u003EiLike\u003C/a\u003E in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn mid 2007, MySpace acquired \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket\" title=\"PhotoBucket\"\u003EPhotoBucket\u003C/a\u003E for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation\" title=\"News Corporation\"\u003ENews Corporation\u003C/a\u003E sold a 2/3 stake in \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket\" title=\"Photobucket\"\u003EPhotobucket\u003C/a\u003E to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe\" title=\"Chris DeWolfe\"\u003EChris DeWolfe\u003C/a\u003E was replaced by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta\" title=\"Owen Van Natta\"\u003EOwen Van Natta\u003C/a\u003E, in a publicized firing. President and head of product, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson\" title=\"Tom Anderson\"\u003ETom Anderson\u003C/a\u003E, was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/\" title=\"reported US$35 million\"\u003Ereported US$35 million\u003C/a\u003E.

online global interactive platform allowing music fans in Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to experience music in the social networking space\r\nMusic fans can enter a competition demonstrating their reporting skills and win the opportunity to present from a music event in an MTV show episode online and on mobile.\r\nVodafone, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest mobile community and MySpace, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading social network, today announced the launch of an online global interactive platform, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which will expand Vodafone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music activity and continue to deliver a unique music experience to Vodafone customers. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d interactive profile, hosted on MySpace, builds on the successful collaboration of both companies which began in 2007 with the launch of MySpace on Vodafone mobile internet.\r\n\r\nVodafone will use the profile to share its existing music initiatives, including summer festivals such as Music Unlimited Cologne in Germany and Vodafone TBAs in the UK. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d profile will also feature user generated content to help create communities for all music fans initially in Germany, Spain and the UK with Italy to follow in the next few days.\r\n\r\nMusic fans in the four countries can click on www.myspace.com/vodafonemusicreporter_uk (_it in Italy, _es in Spain and _de in Germany) and start sharing their music experiences, upload and download content including pictures and videos related to Vodafone Music Unlimited events. Members of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d community will be able to interact with their fellow users through a blog featuring regular updates on Vodafone Music Unlimited activities.\r\n\r\nAll fans in the above mentioned countries will be able to enter a competition to demonstrate their reporting skills across the Vodafone Music Unlimited events this summer and win the chance to become part of an MTV show episode online and on mobile.\r\n\r\nTo enter the competition, all aspiring MTV reporters need to become a friend of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d community on MySpace and upload a photo and video review of their favourite recent gig experience. Friends of the community will then decide which reports they like the best. The MySpace \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d profile will showcase the winners from each round of the competition. The ultimate winner will be awarded the opportunity to join the MTV crew for a day at an event or festival and experience the making of an episode of a show on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading music TV channel. In addition, the winner will have a chance to record her/his report on-site for the mobile and online version of the show.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a tremendous heritage in understanding what our customers want in terms of music and how our music partnerships enhance the customer experience even further,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says David Wheldon, Global Brand Director at Vodafone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vodafone Music Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d reaches music fans in a way that reflects the latest trends of how music is experienced in the social networking space.

Applications like Zimbra and Zoho have integrated Google Gears in this way, as well as Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own Google Reader. (Update: Zimbra actually uses Mozilla Prism).\r\n\r\nBut in this case, MySpace isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that concerned with offline access (they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turned the feature on yet). Instead, they are leveraging the framework to make their messaging service, which previously didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow searching, sorting or any other basic organization techniques, into a much more useful feature.\r\n\r\nGoogle Gears performs three basic functions that are available to developers via Javascript. Those functions are a local database (SQLite), a local server for caching objects such as images and web pages, and a thread pool that allows updates and actions to take place asynchronously in the background. MySpace has taken advantage of Google Gears by using the local cache and background processes to enhance a number of previously resource-intensive processes on the site.\r\n\r\nThe two main areas of MySpace that previously just used only Ajax and relied on server-side processing were the messaging inbox and friendslists. The previous behavior was that a user would click and then have to wait for the request to be received, processed, and sent back from the server. With a large list of messages or a large friends list, common tasks such as these were frustratingly slow.\r\n\r\nBy using Gears, MySpace takes advantage of desktop processing and the locally installed database to speed these actions up to the point where they perform like a desktop application. This also has the benefit of cost-savings for MySpace, as this processing work is moved off-server.\r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been testing the new feature for a few days on my MySpace page. Instead of scrolling through pages and pages of messages, users can now sort by date, from, status (read/unread) or subject. And, more importantly, users can also search the full text of messages. The results are shown instantly (think Outlook), without page refreshes.\r\n\r\n170 million messages are sent per day on MySpace, says the company. Not all users will be offered the new feature right away. Any user with at least 5,000 mail messages in their inbox will be prompted with the option of installing Gears and using the new system. Also, any MySpace user that has already installed Gears will have the option of using the new system.\r\n\r\nHello? Facebook?\r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been complaining about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging system, which suffers from the same problems as MySpace, since late last year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason why Facebook can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t implement Gears, too, and fix most of the problems with their own messaging. But given the epic social networking wars between Facebook on one side, and MySpace/Google on the other (in all of its petty glory), it may be some time before Facebook begins to adopt open standards first pushed by Google. Perhaps someday soon we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see Facebook Gears, or something similar.",    "source_description": "MySpace Shows Facebook How It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Done: Google Gears To Power Messaging",    "stoneable_type": "Company",    "stoned_value": null,    "stoned_value_type": null,    "stoned_acquirer": null,    "stoneable":     {"name": "MySpace",      "permalink": "myspace"}},   {"description": "MySpace Announces Global Partnership with RIM",    "stoned_year": 2008,    "stoned_month": 9,    "stoned_day": 11,    "source_url": "",    "source_text": "SAN FRANCISCO and WATERLOO, ON\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSeptember 11, 2008*\u00e2\u20ac\u201dMySpace, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\r\npremier social network, and Research In Motion (RIM) (Nasdaq: RIMM; TSX:\r\nRIM), a global leader in wireless innovation, today announced they are\r\njoining forces to develop an integrated MySpace Mobile experience\r\ncustomized for BlackBerry\u00c2\u00ae smartphones.
