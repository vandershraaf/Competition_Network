Current social networks have become boring and consumed with collecting user\u0026#8217;s data.  When MySpace launched in 2003 it gained huge success because of the fun interaction and profile customization people had on the site. Facebook gained success with its minimalist design; Necter is a medium between the two, offering fun interaction and basic profile customization. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there is one social network people use: Facebook. Necter hopes to offer a competitive alternative for users who want something new and different. Necter\u0026#8217;s  competition to Facebook will spur innovation and creativity among social media. Necter is continuing to develop and innovate to create a better service for their users.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       40],      "assets/images/resized/0013/7237/137237v4-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       67],      "assets/images/resized/0013/7237/137237v4-max-250x250.png"],     [[335,       90],      "assets/images/resized/0013/7237/137237v4-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Co-Founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "Ryan",      "last_name": "Gehrig",      "permalink": "ryan-gehrig"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Co-Founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "Dave",      "last_name": "Keller",      "permalink": "dave-keller-2"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "Facebook",      "permalink": "facebook"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "MySpace",      "permalink": "myspace"}},   {"competitor":     {"name": "Diaspora",      "permalink": "diaspora"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        110],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7234/137234v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        183],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7234/137234v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        330],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7234/137234v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null},   {"available_sizes":     [[[150,        110],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7235/137235v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        183],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7235/137235v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        330],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7235/137235v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null},   {"available_sizes":     [[[150,        110],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7236/137236v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[250,        183],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7236/137236v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[450,        330],       "assets/images/resized/0013/7236/137236v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  []}
