Initially the site received the name ZipMe and had its name changed when it joined the BuscaP\u00c3\u00a9 Group in September 2010. The initial idea was to launch a collective shopping site that offers discounts to users and wholesalers the possibility of making a sale to a large-scale production of various types, but the advertising professionals noted that it would not be a good business to compete in this environment that already had big names. Then they had the idea of putting all existing collective purchasing sites in one place, would be easier for the Internet surfer to find the deals.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       73],      "assets/images/resized/0015/4492/154492v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       122],      "assets/images/resized/0015/4492/154492v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[254,       124],      "assets/images/resized/0015/4492/154492v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition":  {"price_amount": null,   "price_currency_code": "USD",   "term_code": null,   "source_url": "",   "source_description": "",   "acquired_year": 2010,   "acquired_month": 9,   "acquired_day": null,   "acquiring_company":    {"name": "Buscap\u00e9",     "permalink": "buscape"}}, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo Office",    "address1": "Av.
