The platform can be configured to interface with map-based programs, enterprise grade data analysis tools, or custom applications. Macrosense can push data streams to websites or mobile apps for real-time display, or act as a real-time service supporting other processes.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       25],      "assets/images/resized/0002/0103/20103v1-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       42],      "assets/images/resized/0002/0103/20103v1-max-250x250.png"],     [[265,       45],      "assets/images/resized/0002/0103/20103v1-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [{"name": "Macrosense",    "permalink": "macrosense"},   {"name": "Citysense",    "permalink": "citysense"}], "relationships":  [{"is_past": true,    "title": "Founder, CEO \u0026 Chairman",    "person":     {"first_name": "Greg",      "last_name": "Skibiski",      "permalink": "greg-skibiski"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Chief Privacy Advocate and Co-Founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "Alex",      "last_name": "Pentland",      "permalink": "alex-pentland"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Chief Scientist and Co-Founder",    "person":     {"first_name": "Tony",      "last_name": "Jebara",      "permalink": "tony-jebara"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "COO and Co-Founder ",    "person":     {"first_name": "Christine",      "last_name": "Lemke",      "permalink": "christine-lemke"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "EVP",    "person":     {"first_name": "Mikki",      "last_name": "Nasch",      "permalink": "mikki-nasch"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$9M", "funding_rounds":  [{"round_code": "a",    "source_url": "http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/09/sense-networks-experiments-with-indexing-the-city/",    "source_description": "VentureBeat",    "raised_amount": 3000000.0,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2008,    "funded_month": 4,    "funded_day": null,    "investments":     [{"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "Drobny Global",         "permalink": "drobny-global"},       "person": null},      {"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "The Challenge Funds",         "permalink": "the-challenge-funds"},       "person": null},      {"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "Passport Capital",         "permalink": "passport-capital"},       "person": null}]},   {"round_code": "b",    "source_url": "http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/06/26/sense-networks-gets-6m-in-hotly-contested-deal-for-tribe-advertising/",    "source_description": "Sense Networks gets $6M in hotly contested deal for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tribe\u00e2\u20ac\u009d advertising",    "raised_amount": 6000000.0,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2009,    "funded_month": 6,    "funded_day": 26,    "investments":     [{"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "Intel Capital",         "permalink": "intel-capital"},       "person": null}]}], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": null,    "address1": "110 Greene Street ",    "address2": "11th Floor",    "zip_code": "10012",    "city": "New York City",    "state_code": "NY",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": 40.724647,    "longitude": -73.999636}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://gigaom.com/2008/06/09/sense-networks-citysense/",    "title": "Using the iPhone to Mine for Gold \u0026 Sense"},   {"external_url": "http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-9962810-36.html?tag=nefd.riv",    "title": "Meet Sense Networks, the latest player in the hot 'geo' market"},   {"external_url": "http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/06/citysense-reality-mining-iphone.html",    "title": "Citysense: Let's You Know What Everybody's Doing"},   {"external_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/science/17map.html?_r=1\u0026ref=science",    "title": "The Cellphone, Navigating Our Lives"},   {"external_url": "http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_10/b4122042889229.htm",    "title": "Mapping a New, Mobile Internet"},   {"external_url": "http://www.newsweek.com/id/186970",    "title": "A Trillion Points of Data"},   {"external_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/technology/22proto.html?_r=1\u0026sq=sense%20networks\u0026st=nyt\u0026adxnnl=1\u0026oref=slogin\u0026scp=1\u0026adxnnlx=1239822268-g5bzVuVooQskZRb8Mxuv6Q",    "title": "Predicting Where You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll Go and What You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll Like"},   {"external_url": "http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/tq/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13725679",    "title": "Sensors and Sensitivity"}]}
