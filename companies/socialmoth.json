You can view postings (mostly gossip and secrets) from the whole community as well as get updates for when someone in your group of friends makes a post. The vast majority of their members appear to be women, with over 600 posts being made per day. These guys will also be taking a new spin on their idea, launching Disenchat.com, a place to post anonymously about your workplace. The system will verify your organization by email address (like Facebook) and let you start riffing. Outsiders will be able to see the existence of the forum and volume of posting, but not the specific comments.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[128,       32],      "assets/images/resized/0001/5782/15782v1-max-150x150.png"],     [[128,       32],      "assets/images/resized/0001/5782/15782v1-max-250x250.png"],     [[128,       32],      "assets/images/resized/0001/5782/15782v1-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [{"round_code": "seed",    "source_url": "http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/demo-day-y-combinators-spring-chicks/",    "source_description": "Demo Day: Y Combinator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spring Chicks",    "raised_amount": null,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2007,    "funded_month": 1,    "funded_day": 1,    "investments":     [{"company":        {"name": "Y Combinator",         "permalink": "y-combinator"},       "financial_org": null,       "person": null}]}], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "",    "address1": "857 cole st",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "94117",    "city": "San Francisco",    "state_code": "CA",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": 37.766,    "longitude": -122.450011}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  []}
