Initially, SongFlame will attract users using a Facebook application named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luvnote\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to gain adoption. We anticipate that sponsors will pay us $.10 per song stream sent, in exchange for being able to advertise during the process. The cost for providing a song stream is only $.015 each, which allows for high margins.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusic downloading, internet dating, and social networking sites are multi-billion dollar growth industries.  But these businesses miss the subtleties of meeting or interacting with a person in real life. In addition, many dating websites have high numbers of profiles compared to paying subscribers who are really serious about meeting potential dates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter we develop a user base in Facebook, the luvnote application will be updated to work alongside any online dating website. There are no competitors offering this service and SongFlame would not be competing with the existing online dating sites. There are 9,800 dating websites worldwide with more than 100 million users in the United States alone. If we can engage just 1% of the total dating market to use the luvnote application, the company will easily have over a million daters sending song streams as flirts. With the average online dater sending 10 flirts per month, it could easily translate to a million dollars per month in revenue with an 85% gross margin. SongFlame creates a powerful motivation for people to spend money on legitimate music downloads: the ability to connect with a potential date or share a song with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       53],      "assets/images/resized/0011/4875/114875v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       89],      "assets/images/resized/0011/4875/114875v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[450,       161],      "assets/images/resized/0011/4875/114875v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "CFO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Paul",      "last_name": "Heynderickx",      "permalink": "paul-heynderickx-2"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "CEO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Rod",      "last_name": "Underhill",      "permalink": "rod-underhill"}},   {"is_past": true,    "title": "CTO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Capra",      "last_name": "J'neva",      "permalink": "capra-jneva"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Advisor",    "person":     {"first_name": "Paul",      "last_name": "Anthony",      "permalink": "paul-anthony"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Director of Sales",    "person":     {"first_name": "Betsy",      "last_name": "Hand",      "permalink": "betsy-hand"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Founder \u0026 Visionary",    "person":     {"first_name": "Patrick",      "last_name": "Smith",      "permalink": "patrick-smith-2"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Chief Product Officer",    "person":     {"first_name": "Cori",      "last_name": "Taratoot",      "permalink": "cori-taratoot"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "CTO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Jesse",      "last_name": "Johnston",      "permalink": "jesse-johnston"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [{"title": "Legal Counsel",    "is_past": false,    "provider":     {"name": "Richard Hattenhauer",      "permalink": "richard-hattenhauer"}},   {"title": "Patent Counsel",    "is_past": false,    "provider":     {"name": "Klarquist Sparkman, LLP",      "permalink": "klarquist-sparkman-llp"}}], "total_money_raised": "$75k", "funding_rounds":  [{"round_code": "seed",    "source_url": "",    "source_description": "",    "raised_amount": 75000.0,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2010,    "funded_month": 11,    "funded_day": 23,    "investments":     []}], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "",    "address1": "5550 SW Macadam Ave. Suite 215",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "97239",    "city": "Portland",    "state_code": "OR",    "country_code": "USA",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  []}
