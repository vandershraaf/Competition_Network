Following several months of research and development, the product was launched in collaboration with various car rental agencies and tourism-related advertisers. Feedback from this initial launch of 200 units came back very positive, and the company has grown from strength to strength.  The company has since expanded its operations to Spain and New Zealand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Concept:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETourism Radio\u00ae uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to provide location-based information on the go. This is through the use of a specially designed Tourism Radio\u00ae device, or a GPS-enabled mobile phone application. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocation based advertising has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the mobile phone industry, and\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETourism Radio\u00ae combines this with intelligently structured audio travel information that appeals to the listener.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe GPS device and mobile application are programmed in such a way that listeners are given information about their surroundings, as they move from place to place. This information varies as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 General information and music are played when the listener is in a \u201cdefault area\u201d that is without any specific stored information, or if the listener has already listened to all the area information available. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Information about local culture, language, must-see places and attractions, as well as general curiosities and anecdotes are also played.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 When the listener then moves into a set geographic area of interest, the information and music played are specific to that area, giving the listener a tailor made programme as they travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Point-of-interest information is also provided when the listener is in close proximity to them, providing on-the-go suggestions about what to see and do.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       65],      "assets/images/resized/0005/7439/57439v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[236,       103],      "assets/images/resized/0005/7439/57439v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[236,       103],      "assets/images/resized/0005/7439/57439v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [{"name": "Hummba.com",    "permalink": "hummba-com"}], "relationships":  [{"is_past": true,    "title": "CEO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Jacques",      "last_name": "Teichmann",      "permalink": "jacques-teichmann"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "CEO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Mark",      "last_name": "Allewell",      "permalink": "mark-allewell"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Digital Manager",    "person":     {"first_name": "Sophia",      "last_name": "Karalis",      "permalink": "sophia-karalis"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Office Manager",    "person":     {"first_name": "Francesco",      "last_name": "Stemmet",      "permalink": "francesco-stemmet"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Managing Director, Australasia",    "person":     {"first_name": "Hayden",      "last_name": "Braddock",      "permalink": "hayden-braddock"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Sound Development",    "person":     {"first_name": "Warren",      "last_name": "Read",      "permalink": "warren-read"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "QA",    "person":     {"first_name": "Ryan",      "last_name": "Mathers",      "permalink": "ryan-mathers"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "Tourism Radio Int ",    "address1": "Head Office",    "address2": "c/ Verdi 217, bajos",    "zip_code": "08024",    "city": "Barcelona",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "ESP",    "latitude": 41.4135895,    "longitude": 2.1573033},   {"description": "Tourism Radio SA Pty Ltd ",    "address1": "27 Plumer Road",    "address2": "Woodstock",    "zip_code": "8000",    "city": "Cape Town",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "ZAF",    "latitude": -33.93155,    "longitude": 18.45045}], "milestones":  [{"description": "Tourism Radio is acquired by a German Venture Capitalist.",    "stoned_year": 2007,    "stoned_month": 5,    "stoned_day": 1,    "source_url": "http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/advantage-rent-a-car-partners-with-tourism-radio-hawaii-offer-virtual-tour-guide-service-878194.htm",    "source_text": null,    "source_description": "Tourism Radio expanding across the globe",    "stoneable_type": "Company",    "stoned_value": null,    "stoned_value_type": null,    "stoned_acquirer": null,    "stoneable":     {"name": "Tourism Radio",      "permalink": "tourism-radio"}}], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        138],       "assets/images/resized/0011/1169/111169v2-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[250,        230],       "assets/images/resized/0011/1169/111169v2-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[450,        414],       "assets/images/resized/0011/1169/111169v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://www.southafrica.info/travel/advice/tourism-radio.htm",    "title": "Tuning into to Tourism Radio"},   {"external_url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Radio",    "title": "Tourism Radio "},   {"external_url": "http://www.capetownalive.co.za/news/tourism-radio-hits-cape-town.html",    "title": "Tourism Radio Hits Cape Town"}]}
