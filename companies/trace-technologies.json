In addition, optic fibre reduces aircraft weight so improving fuel economy and increases the aircraft\u0026#8217;s range.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile both commercial and military aerospace manufacturers are keen to embrace the benefits of fibre optic cabling, the harsh working environment demands a high standard of system design. Designers need reliable tools to enable them to create harnesses that work first time, every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrace Technologies provides the solution with PISD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 - the first dedicated practical engineering tool that means aerospace system engineers can easily design, install, test and build reliable fibre optic cable harnesses for next generation systems on today\u0026#8217;s aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       91],      "assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-150x150.jpg"],     [[154,       94],      "assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-250x250.jpg"],     [[154,       94],      "assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$1.18M", "funding_rounds":  [{"round_code": "unattributed",    "source_url": "",    "source_description": "Cap Funding Report",    "raised_amount": 1180000.0,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2007,    "funded_month": 3,    "funded_day": 27,    "investments":     [{"company":        {"name": "Xenos",         "permalink": "xenos"},       "financial_org": null,       "person": null},      {"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "HSBC  Principal Investments",         "permalink": "hsbc-principal-investments"},       "person": null},      {"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "Welsh Assembly Government",         "permalink": "welsh-assembly-government"},       "person": null},      {"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "Finance Wales Investments",         "permalink": "finance-wales-investments"},       "person": null}]}], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "HQ",    "address1": "",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "",    "city": "",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "GBR",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        118],       "assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[250,        198],       "assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[450,        356],       "assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  []}
