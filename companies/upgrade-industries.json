BoardX is a collection of electronic circuit boards that stack on top of one another to share resources, communicate, and extend the functionality of one another. This system is built on the motherboard that acts as both an electrical and structural foundation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike similar products (but much like a familiar PC system), the motherboard does not come with a processor pre-installed. Processors come as simple, low cost add-on boards, which allows any processor - or multiple processors - to be used with the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent add-ons include non-volatile memory, Arduino compatible microcontroller, analog to digital converter, XBee mesh network radio, motor controller, do-it-yourself prototyping board and a PIC microprocessor board.\u003C/p\u003E", "image": null, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "CEO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Kevin",      "last_name": "Green",      "permalink": "kevin-green"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "COO",    "person":     {"first_name": "Dave",      "last_name": "Harries",      "permalink": "dave-harries"}}], "competitions":  [{"competitor":     {"name": "Arduino",      "permalink": "arduino"}}], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[150,        114],       "assets/images/resized/0016/6772/166772v2-max-150x150.jpg"],      [[250,        190],       "assets/images/resized/0016/6772/166772v2-max-250x250.jpg"],      [[450,        342],       "assets/images/resized/0016/6772/166772v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  [{"external_url": "http://www.gizmag.com/boardx-diy-electronics-kit/20613/",    "title": "BoardX: Arduino on steroids"},   {"external_url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/244636/boardx_stacks_the_deck_against_arduino.html",    "title": "BoardX Stacks the Deck Against Arduino"},   {"external_url": "http://www.nycresistor.com/2011/10/31/boardx-a-new-pluggable-arduino-compatible-board/",    "title": "BoardX \u2013 A new, pluggable, Arduino compatible board"}]}
