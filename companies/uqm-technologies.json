In the early 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the Company designed and manufactured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dune buggies\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for recreational enthusiasts. In the late 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, our focus shiftedelectrek to the development and manufacture of an all-composite, purpose built, environmentally friendly, battery electric passenger automobile tradenamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Electrek.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d During the period from 1978 to 1982, over 75 Electreks were manufactured and sold, some of which are still in operation today. During the development of the Electrek, we began to experiment with concepts for a better performing electric motor that was suited for the propulsion of a vehicle including the delivery of high torque and high speed with exceptional energy efficiency. These efforts led to the invention of our patented core permanent magnet motor technology. Since that time, we have developed and patented numerous extensions of this technology including methods of manufacture, methods of electronic control (including switching circuit architecture and phase timing advancement), the packaging of an electro-mechanical brake inside of a motor and a low cost method for accurately sensing rotor position.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[149,       72],      "assets/images/resized/0007/4530/74530v1-max-150x150.jpg"],     [[149,       72],      "assets/images/resized/0007/4530/74530v1-max-250x250.jpg"],     [[149,       72],      "assets/images/resized/0007/4530/74530v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$45.1M", "funding_rounds":  [{"round_code": "grant",    "source_url": "http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2010/01/uqm_snares_451m.html",    "source_description": "UQM Snares $45.1M From DOE",    "raised_amount": 45100000.0,    "raised_currency_code": "USD",    "funded_year": 2010,    "funded_month": 1,    "funded_day": 20,    "investments":     [{"company": null,       "financial_org":        {"name": "U.S. Department of Energy",         "permalink": "u-s-department-of-energy"},       "person": null}]}], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [], "external_links":  []}
