Applications don\u2019t exist in a vacuum \u2013 databases, web front ends, networks, external appliances, local support libraries, operating systems \u2013 all need to share configuration information and work as a unit for correct application deployment.  Systems that only deal with one component of this application ecosystem add just another disparate piece to an already complex puzzle. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVaraLogix offers a better approach.  We provide the only solution that has been purposely-built, from the ground up, to automate business critical application deployment and configuration management \u2013 in one solution \u2013 removing risk and uncertainty from the deployment process. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe do it differently.  At a high level, we do it by looking at application deployment from an IT Operations perspective.  This makes us uniquely positioned to bridge the Development / IT Operations gap for agile, secure, scalable operations from development to production.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVaraLogix is led by the same experienced team who founded Build Forge, which was acquired by IBM in 2006.
