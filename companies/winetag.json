WINETAG has a strong management team, top qualified TI Engineers ans a sizable long-term market opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAiming at the concept of mobile computing, ubiquitous computing, Internet of Things and 2D codes to store information, the motivation came to the realization of this project, building a social network to carry information given by company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experts and users at bottles of wine and places. The information is encoded in 2D codes like QR Code and is decoded by software using cellular phone cameras to access specific information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe coded information to the QR Codes are collected through evaluations or descriptions of the technical specifications of the wine in a social network called WineTag, where users can also find friends, be followed by other participants, share their assessments and recommendations on other social networks (Facebook, Twitter ), and then, provide information where certain wines can be purchased or tasted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new social networking niche, focused on enogastronomy theme lets users to build a social graph that is different than the one that used to be built by major networks such as Facebook. Instead of connecting the users profiles to their friends, groups, photos and instant messaging, this new social graph connects people to things (wine, restaurants, wine shops, wineries, importers), thus creating a graph that can and must be connected to the graph of bigger social networks to generate recommendations and information about the\u0026#8221; things \u0026#8220;around the users and their friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe connections made in the graph shared between different social networks, micro blogs, sites, search engines, etc., and the ways that systems can cover the same from a particular user, allow the identification, personalization and customization of preferences user.\u003C/p\u003E", "image":  {"available_sizes":    [[[150,       63],      "assets/images/resized/0011/5654/115654v2-max-150x150.png"],     [[250,       105],      "assets/images/resized/0011/5654/115654v2-max-250x250.png"],     [[450,       190],      "assets/images/resized/0011/5654/115654v2-max-450x450.png"]],   "attribution": null}, "products":  [], "relationships":  [{"is_past": false,    "title": "Chief Technology Officer ",    "person":     {"first_name": "Marcio",      "last_name": "Cunha",      "permalink": "marcio-cunha"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Managing director",    "person":     {"first_name": "Jo\u00c3\u00a3o",      "last_name": "Paulo Alves",      "permalink": "joo-paulo-alves"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "Legal director",    "person":     {"first_name": "Josemar",      "last_name": "Torres",      "permalink": "josemar-torres"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "System Engineer",    "person":     {"first_name": "Bruno",      "last_name": "Nunes",      "permalink": "bruno-nunes"}},   {"is_past": false,    "title": "System Engineer",    "person":     {"first_name": "Gustavo",      "last_name": "Mourad",      "permalink": "gustavo-mourad"}}], "competitions":  [], "providerships":  [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "funding_rounds":  [], "investments":  [], "acquisition": null, "acquisitions":  [], "offices":  [{"description": "Central Office",    "address1": "Av. das Am\u00c3\u00a9ricas, 7935, bl B, sl. 555",    "address2": "",    "zip_code": "22794081",    "city": "Rio de Janeiro",    "state_code": null,    "country_code": "BRA",    "latitude": null,    "longitude": null}], "milestones":  [], "ipo": null, "video_embeds":  [], "screenshots":  [{"available_sizes":     [[[87,        150],       "assets/images/resized/0011/5652/115652v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[145,        250],       "assets/images/resized/0011/5652/115652v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[261,        450],       "assets/images/resized/0011/5652/115652v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null},   {"available_sizes":     [[[108,        150],       "assets/images/resized/0011/5653/115653v2-max-150x150.png"],      [[180,        250],       "assets/images/resized/0011/5653/115653v2-max-250x250.png"],      [[325,        450],       "assets/images/resized/0011/5653/115653v2-max-450x450.png"]],    "attribution": null}], "external_links":  []}
